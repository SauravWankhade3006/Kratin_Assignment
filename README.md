<h1> Medicine-Reminder to Live a Healthier and Better Life</h1>
<p1>
  One use case for elderly care could be to help Sunita Sharma manage her medications. As people age, they often have to take multiple medications to manage different health conditions, and it can be challenging to keep track of what medications to take and when to take them.

To help Sunita manage her medications, I would create a working prototype of a medication reminder app. The app would allow Sunita to input all of her medications and set reminders for when to take them.

## Problem Statement
How can you help Sunita Sharma (65+ years old) to live a healthier and better life?
Identify one use case for elderly care (for the age group 65+) and create a working prototype to demonstrate 
your idea using technology known to you.

## Solution

#a fullly automated e-prescription medicine reminder.

* The doctor will write digital prescriptions on our app which will be saved on user's profile.
* We will send out automatical reminders for the patients to take their medicines (entirely based off what is written in the prescription.) 

## Use Cases

* sunita won't have to set reminders manually. Hence, there is no way for them to procrastinate.
* sunita won't have to keep a physical binder to maintain their medical history.
* sunita won't have to confuse themselves by reading the (mostly incomprehensible) handwriting of the doctor once they forget their medicines, dosage, or timings.

## Unique Selling Point (USP)
it is a medicine reminder app, but you don't have to set reminders for your medicines. ðŸ˜‰
